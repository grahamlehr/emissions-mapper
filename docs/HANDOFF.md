# Handoff
_Updated 2026-11-02 · branch `claude/emissions-mapper-review-7e779c` · PR not opened yet (public repo, needs Graham's OK)_

## Goal
Publish the emissions mapper as a public GitHub Pages site, review it, restyle it in Signal, and fix the review's findings.

## Done
- Repo scaffolded from the repo kit. The code review is in `docs/REVIEW.md`.
- Signal restyle merged to `main` (PR 1).
- Review bugs and housekeeping fixed on `claude/emissions-mapper-review-7e779c`:
  - the model is split into `src/model.js`, with `node --test` tests
  - whole-word, country-first matching with 90 airports and no London fallback
  - an unplaced-groups banner, with those groups left out of totals
  - return trips by default
  - CSV parsing that handles semicolons, quoted newlines and thousands separators
  - SheetJS 0.20.3 with SRI
  - focus kept on airport selects
  - duplicate handlers removed
  - a Heat toggle

  Verified locally (Chrome-based browser pane, desktop width). Not checked on a phone.

## Next
- Push the branch and open its PR (needs Graham's OK: public repo).
- Product backlog in `docs/REVIEW.md`. Suggested order: 3 (ranked comparison table), 10 (pan to selection and label collisions, now worse with 90 airports), 4 (method note), 6, 7.

## Open decisions (need Graham)
- Which product suggestions to build next, and in what order.

## Decided: don't relitigate
See `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## Gotchas
- Public repo: every push publishes. Ask before pushing, opening PRs or merging.
- ES modules need the local server. `file://` won't work.

## State
`main` is live on GitHub Pages. The review-fix branch is local only.

## Prompt for the next session
Read AGENTS.md, docs/DECISIONS.md and docs/REVIEW.md first, in /Users/graham/Projects/EmissionsMapper. Then build the next product suggestions from REVIEW.md.
